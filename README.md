## Project Overview

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The started code as well as [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was included. The task was to write test as written below.

## How to run the application?

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html in your browser. This will display the feed as well as the Jasmine test results. Jasmine will show the specs passed and failures for the test.

Review the Feed Reader Testing Rubric [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric)

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
7. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
8. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
